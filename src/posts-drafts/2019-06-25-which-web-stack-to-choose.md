If you want to develop web or mobile applications you will start to research the stack you're
going to use. As a frontend dev you probably will hear about `react`, `vue`, `angularjs` or even `svelte`. 
As a backend guy you will discover `Google Cloud - Firebase`, `Microsoft Azure` or `Amazon Web Services`.

I won't go through in depth with aws amplify and lambda here but here is some really rough overview
of the both technologies.
