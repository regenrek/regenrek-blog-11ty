I always set my goals first to have a clear mind what I've want to achieve. 


- **Set a Deadline:** Especially on side projects its important (for me) to have a deadline since my side projects are mostly "when it's done". 

- **Improve your Stack:** I want to use a technology which I want to get used to and which I will need to use in future. 

- **Have fun:** I guess this should be obvious but side projects should be fun since in first place you don't earn money for it. I do it because I can train my brain like solving puzzles in a game.
